    <p>Trump decided hastily to remove Mattis in reaction to negative news coverage, according to senior administration
        officials, one of whom said the president was eager to retaliate against Mattis and show up the widely
        respected former general. Another official said Trump and other advisers suspected Mattis of being part of a
        campaign to stoke negative coverage about the president.</p>

    <p>After cancelling his Christmas trip to Florida in view of the partial government shutdown, Trump was marooned
        this weekend at the White House, watching hours of cable television news shows. Advisers said he stewed over
        commentary hailing Mattis as heroic — a human guardrail against the president’s impulses.</p>

    <p>Trump was so angry with Mattis that on Sunday morning he directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to inform the
        defence secretary that he was being removed from office two months early, according to a senior administration
        official. Trump himself has not spoken to Mattis since last Thursday, when the secretary resigned.</p>

    <p>Mattis resigned in protest after Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria over the strong
        objections of Mattis and others on the national security team. Brett McGurk, the top U.S. envoy to the
        international coalition fighting Daesh (also known as ISIS), also resigned in protest over Trump’s Syria
        decision.</p>
