        In May 2006 Nankai's president Rao Zihe tendered 15 of the 21 university's college dean positions.

    <p>After 1980, Nankai added a number of new specialities and institutes. In Arts, applied specialities on financing
        were set up and the School of Economics was reopened in 1983, while in Sciences, interdisciplinary, marginal
        and high and new technological specialities were added.</p>

    <p>Nankai was amongst the first universities in China to open its doors for students from America in the 1980s.[16]
        In 1989 the university was ordered by the Tianjin public security bureau to send two Americans back home,
        following rising political tensions over pro-democracy demonstrations.[17]</p>

    <p>By the late 1980s, Nankai University had grown to be a comprehensive university embracing Humanities, Natural
        Sciences, Applied Sciences, Life Sciences, Managements and Art.</p>

    <p>In 1994 Tianjin Foreign Trade College was merged to Nankai university. In 1999 under the combined efforts of
        Nankai and TEDA, TEDA College was set up. In 2000 the State Ministry of Education signed an agreement with
        Tianjin Municipal Government on jointly establishing and developing Nankai University. Experimental cooperation
        between Nankai University and Tianjin University was initiated on the principle of independent school-running
        and close cooperation. In 2002 under the cooperative efforts of Nankai, Government of Shenzhen and UC Berkeley,
        the Financial Engineering College was established in Shenzhen.</p>

    <p>In May 2006 Nankai's president Rao Zihe tendered 15 of the 21 university's college dean positions, restaffing
        key positions in an effort to further improve the university's educational programs.[18]</p>

    <p>In February 2015, following Chinese media reports and statements from inside the Chinese Communist Party that
        universities would have to "be cleansed of liberal Western textbooks and other ideological heresies" , Nankai's
        president Gong Ke publicly stated: "Recently I've read people on the Internet saying that the ranks of
        academics must be cleansed, purified and rectified. I can't agree with this. This was the mentality of 1957 or
        1966." and "We cannot re-enact this history of "leftist" errors against intellectuals."</p>
